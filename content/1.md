In this epsiode, Eric and Russell review the first solo outing for Nightwing.
This 4 part series, published in 1995-1996 and written by Dennis O’Neil with art by
Greg Land, tells the story of Dick Grayson looking for insight into the murder of
his parents.  The story begins with Nightwing saving the life of Miggy Webster and
follows his journey to Kravia, where he learns the story of what happened to the
Flying Graysons.  

This book feels like it was written in the 1990’s and shows its age.  Listen to this
episode to hear what Eric and Russell have to say about this outing, 90’s hair, the
portrayal of women in comics, and the beginning of Nightwing in his solo career.
