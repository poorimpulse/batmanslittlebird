In this episode, Eric and Russell review the sixth issue in the ongoing series of Nightwing.
The Visitor was published in March 1997, written by Chuck Dixon with art by Scott McDaniel.

In this issue, we get a visit from an old friend from Gotham.  No not that Caped Crusader, but the
other little bird.  We see more of Soames.  Someone gets whacked.  And BOOM goes the dynamite!
What did Eric and Russell think of this issue?  Listen and find out!
