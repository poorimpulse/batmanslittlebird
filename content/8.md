In this episode, Eric and Russell review the seventh issue in the ongoing series of Nightwing.  Rough Justice was
published in April 1997, written by Chuck Dixon with art by Scott McDaniel. 

In this issue, we kick off a 9 issue arc as Dick goes on the rampage.  He is determined to find out who is behind the
corpses left in Gotham!  Is it the Butcher?  The Baker?  The Candlestick Maker?  NO, this isn't Batman ‘66!  Lots of
loose ends are wrapped up, including a nice package in a 55 gallon drum!  What did Eric and Russell think of this
issue?  Listen and find out!
