In this episode, Eric and Russell review the eighth issue in the ongoing series of Nightwing.  The Bigger They Are  was published in May 1997, written by Chuck Dixon with art by Scott McDaniel. 

In this issue, Nightwing fits Blockbuster, it's kinda like arguing with them about rewind fees.  Motorcycle gangs, visions of the bat, and allusions of things to come.  What did Eric and Russell think of this issue?  Listen and find out!
