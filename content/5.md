In this episode, Eric and Russell review the fourth issue in the ongoing series of
Nightwing.  Lady Be Deadly was published in January 1997, written by Chuck Dixon
with art by Scott McDaniel.

In this issue, we start a brand new story arc!  A mysterious, buxom, & blonde
bombshell, more furry features, and maybe a little this for that?  What did Eric and
Russell think of this issue?  Listen and find out!

## Nightwing Movie?!

Rumor has it that [Chris McKay](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003021) (Robot Chicken, Lego Batman) has been slated to direct a
live action Nightwing movie.  Who would you cast as our beloved Dick?

Eric had three picks:
* [Harry Lloyd](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516003)
* [Lewis Tan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1167985)
* [Steven Yeun](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3081796)

Russell had one pick:
* [Godfrey Gao](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3295837)
