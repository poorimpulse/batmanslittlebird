<h1>Russell Hay</h1>
</header>
<article class="description">

<p>Russell's obsession with Dick Grayson didn't begin until later in life.
He began his Trapeze performing career as a member of Dick Grayson and Mrs. Peel,
and from there he was hooked. He devoured everything Dick related, and even made
himself a vinyl sticker of the Nighwing symbol for his car.</p>

<p>He blogs about filmmaking, code, and art on his website
<a href="http://russellhay.com">RussellHay.com</a>, and runs a second podcast called
<a href="http://poorimpulse.co">Poor Impulse Control</a> where he writes and narrates
action stories.</p>
