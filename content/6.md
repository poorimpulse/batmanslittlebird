In this episode, Eric and Russell review the fifth issue in the ongoing series
of Nightwing.  Lady’s Night was published in February 1997, written by Chuck
Dixon with art by Scott McDaniel.

In this issue, we continue where we left off last issue.  A Lady has no name,
or maybe she does? Are Soames’ hands are dirtier than we thought?  Who is the
consigliore?  We answer some of the questions, maybe not all them in this episode!
What did Eric and Russell think of this issue?  Listen and find out!
