In this episode, Eric and Russell review the third in the ongoing series of
Nightwing.  Freebooters was published in December 1996, written by Chuck Dixon
with art by Scott McDaniel.

This issue is supposed to be the conclusion to the beginning of the Nightwing story,
but we really didn't see the conclusion of the opening of the story.
Dick gets him some Reynard, still have the mysterious Irish lass, and we learn less
about the Sons of Minh!  What did Eric and Russell think of this episode?  Listen
and find out!
