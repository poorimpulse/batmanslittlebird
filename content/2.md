In this episode, Eric and Russell review the first in the ongoing series of Nightwing.  Child of Justice was
published in October of 1996, written by Chuck Dixon with art by Scott McDaniel.

This issue begins the Bludhaven story arc for Nightwing.  There is some great setup for the ongoing story in this
issue.  We meet an old Batman villain, get introduced to a band of bad furries, and run into the trope of corrupt cops.
Listen in to see how Eric and Russell felt about this issue and how they feel about Nightwing’s first ongoing story arc.
